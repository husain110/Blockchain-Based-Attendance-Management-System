Developed a secure and tamper-proof attendance system using blockchain technology. Implemented smart contracts to ensure transparency, immutability, and real-time verification of student attendance records. The project used Python, web3.py, and Solidity with a simple web interface for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This system reduces the risk of data manipulation and improves the reliability of institutional attendance tracking.
